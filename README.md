## Install

### Install PaddlePaddle

This dependency will be automatically satisfied when users install Paddle Quantum. Please refer to [PaddlePaddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick)'s official installation and configuration page. This project requires PaddlePaddle 2.2.0 to 2.3.0.

### Install Paddle Quantum

We recommend the following way of installing Paddle Quantum with `pip`,

```bash
pip install paddle-quantum
```
or download all the files and finish the installation locally,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/quantum
cd quantum
pip install -e .
```

### Environment setup for Quantum Chemistry module

Currently, our `qchem` module uses `PySCF` as its backend to compute molecular integrals, so before executing quantum chemistry, we have to install this Python package.

> It is recommended that `PySCF` is installed in a Python environment whose Python version >=3.6.

We highly recommend you to install `PySCF` via conda. **MacOS/Linux** user can use the command:

```bash
conda install -c pyscf pyscf
```

> NOTE: For **Windows** user, if your operating system is Windows10, you can install `PySCF` in Ubuntu subsystem provided by Windows 10's App Store. `PySCF` can't run directly in Windows, so we are working hard to develop more quantum chemistry backends. Our support for Windows will be improved in the coming release of Paddle Quantum.

**Note:** Please refer to [PySCF](https://pyscf.org/install.html) for more download options.

### Run example

Now, you can try to run a program to verify whether Paddle Quantum has been installed successfully. Here we take quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) as an example.

```bash
cd paddle_quantum/QAOA/example
python main.py
```

> For the introduction of QAOA, please refer to our [QAOA tutorial](./tutorials/combinatorial_optimization/QAOA_EN.ipynb).

### Breaking Change

In version 2.2.0 of Paddle Quantum, we have made an incompatible upgrade to the code architecture, and the new version's structure and usage can be found in our [tutorials](https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/overview.html), [API documentation](https://qml.baidu.com/api/introduction.html), and [the source code](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Quantum). Also, we support connecting to a real quantum computer via [QuLeaf](https://github.com/baidu/QCompute), using `paddle_quantum.set_backend('quleaf')` to select QuLeaf as the backend.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Question:** What is quantum machine learning? What are the applications?

    **Answer:** Quantum machine learning (QML) is an interdisciplinary subject that combines quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML). On the one hand, QML utilizes existing artificial intelligence technology to break through the bottleneck of quantum computing research. On the other hand, QML uses the information processing advantages of quantum computing to promote the development of traditional artificial intelligence. QML is not only suitable for quantum chemical simulations (with Variational Quantum Eigensolver) and other quantum problems. It also help researchers to solve classical optimization problems including knapsack problem, traveling salesman problem, and Max-Cut problem through the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm.

2. **Question:** I want to study QML, but I don't know much about quantum computing. Where should I start?

    **Answer:** *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen & Chuang is the classic introductory textbook to QC. We recommend readers to study Chapter 1, 2, and 4 of this book first. These chapters introduce the basic concepts, provide solid mathematical and physical foundations, and discuss the quantum circuit model widely used in QC. Readers can also go through Paddle Quantum's quick start guide, which contains a brief introduction to QC and interactive examples. After building a general understanding of QC, readers can try some cutting-edge QML applications provided as tutorials in Paddle Quantum.

3. **Question:** Currently, there is no fault-tolerant large-scale quantum hardware. How can we develop quantum applications? 

    **Answer:** The development of useful algorithms does not necessarily require a perfect hardware. The latter is more of an engineering problem. With Paddle Quantum, one can develop, simulate, and verify the validity of self-innovated quantum algorithms. Then, researchers can choose to implement these tested quantum algorithms in a small scale hardware and see the actual performance of it. Following this line of reasoning, we can prepare ourselves with many candidates of useful quantum algorithms before the age of matured quantum hardware.
    
4. **Question:** What are the advantages of Paddle Quantum?

    **Answer:** Paddle Quantum is an open-source QML toolkit based on Baidu PaddlePaddle. As the first open-source and industrial level deep learning platform in China, PaddlePaddle has the leading ML technology and rich functionality. With the support of PaddlePaddle, especially its dynamic computational graph mechanism, Paddle Quantum could easily train a QNN and with GPU acceleration. In addition, based on the high-performance quantum simulator developed by Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) at Baidu, Paddle Quantum can simulate more than 20 qubits on personal laptops. Finally, Paddle Quantum provides many open-source QML tutorials for readers from different backgrounds.
