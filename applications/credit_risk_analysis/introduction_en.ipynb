    "The task of risk analysis is to access the risk of given assets facing the fluctuations of financial systems, i.e. the Value at Risk (VaR). Such quantity can measure the potent loss of given assets in a financial system. There are many factors determining the Value of Risk of assets, including the favor of risk for different financial organizations, the characteristics of system fluctuations and the risk-related properties of assets. In 2014 Rutkowski and Tarca [1] provided a mathematical model that estimates the risk measure. This model suggests that the whole financial system can be modelled by a Brownian motion process, so that the minimum upper bound of assets' loss can be computed under an appropriate confidence level."

In particular, when $Z = z$, the parameter $p_k(z)$ of random variable $X_k(Z)$ i.e. the default probability of the $k$-th asset, is dependent on the basic default probability without the effect of financial system $p_k^{(0)} \\in [0, 1]$, and the asset sensitivity to the system risk $\\rho_k \\in [0, 1]$.

    "Unlike classical algorithms, quantum computation can use the algorithm of quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) to replace the classical Monte Carlo method in the second step mentioned above, to enhance the efficiency of probability estimation. Through the characteristics of quantum superposition and entanglement, such quantum scheme is expected to obtain the advantage of quadratic acceleration compared with classical schemes [2]. Next, we will show how to use Paddle Quantum to simulate this quantum scheme to complete the VaR computational problem of credit risk analysis."
