    "## Quantum Random Number Generator\n",
    "*Copyright (c) 2023 Institute for Quantum Computing, Baidu Inc. All Rights Reserved.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Random number generators are methods or devices to generate random number series by algorithms, physical signals, environmental noise, etc. They play an important role in many fields such as cryptography, machine learning, etc. They directly affect the crackability of the key, and the generalization performance of the machine learning model. Classical computers generate pseudo-random numbers by pseudo-random algorithms such as the linear congruence method, which has certain drawbacks like periodicity. In contrast, quantum computers can generate truly random numbers by exploiting the uncertainty of quantum measurements, which is unpredictable. This model library encapsulates methods that can call Baidu's own quantum computers, simulators, and third-party hardware that are online on the Baidu Quantum Cloud Platform to generate random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "The quantum computer can be used to act $H$ gates on the zero initial state $|0\\rangle$ to obtain the quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\sqrt2}{2} |0\\rangle + \\frac{\\sqrt2}{2} |1\\rangle .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ has a probability of being $0$ or $1$ under Pauli-$Z$ quantum measurement (or named computational basis measurement, whose measurement operators are $|0\\rangle\\langle 0|$, $|1\\rangle \\langle 1 |$.) with $\\frac12$. The uncertainty of the collapse of the quantum state ensures that the result obtained for $0$ or $1$ is truly random. Repeat the above process to obtain a random bit string, and the flow diagram is as follows.\n",
    "![random_number](./randnum_EN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the actual quantum computer is a noise-free ideal quantum computer, the measurement result is truly random. However, current quantum computers are noisy, so we also encapsulate the classical privacy-enhancing algorithm, which can filter the effect of noise by using two independent quantum computers (or two independent qubits of one quantum computer) to measure separately to get a long string. Then extract a short string by post-process. The diagram of extractor is shown below.\n",
    "![extractor](./extractor_EN.png)\n",
    "## User's Guide\n",
    "### Quick Start\n",
    "The user can run it by typing `python randnum.py --config config.toml` at the command line, where `config.toml` is the model configuration file, and the user can modify the parameters in this file or enter other files to customize the parameters.\n",
    "### Online Demonstration\n",
    "In the meantime, we give here a version of the online demo that can be customized online. First define the contents of the configuration file."

    "Here, we just need to modify the parameters in the `example_toml` dictionary and run the code above to quickly customize the model. If you want to use Baidu's own quantum computer \"Qian\", you can modify the `backend` parameter to ` 'cloud_baidu_qpu_qian'` (keep the quotes, python string data type), and enter your account `token`. (If you don't have `token`, you can go to [Baidu Quantum Cloud Platform](https://quantum-hub.baidu.com/) to register.)\n",
