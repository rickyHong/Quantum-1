"`Paddle Quantum <https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Quantum>`__\\  is a "
"quantum machine learning toolkit developed based on Baidu PaddlePaddle. "
"It provides a platform to construct and train quantum neural networks "
"(QNN) with easy-to-use QML development kits supporting combinatorial "
"optimization, quantum chemistry and other cutting-edge quantum "
"applications, making PaddlePaddle the first deep learning framework in "
"China that supports quantum machine learning."
