Install PaddlePaddle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This dependency will be automatically satisfied when users install Paddle Quantum. Please refer to `PaddlePaddle <https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick>`__ Install and configuration page. This project requires PaddlePaddle 2.2.0 to 2.3.0.

.. _header-n19:

Install Paddle Quantum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend installing Paddle Quantum with ``pip`` ,

.. code:: shell

   pip install paddle-quantum

or download all the files and finish the installation locally,

.. code:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/quantum

.. code:: shell

   cd quantum
   pip install -e .

Environment setup for Quantum Chemistry module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our `qchem` module is based on `Psi4`, so before executing quantum chemistry, we have to install this Python package.

.. note::

   It is recommended that `Psi4` is installed in a Python 3.8 environment.

We highly recommend you to install ``Psi4`` via conda. MacOS/Linux user can use the command

.. code:: shell

   conda install psi4 -c psi4

For **Windows** user, the command is

.. code:: shell

   conda install psi4 -c psi4 -c conda-forge

**Note:** Please refer to `Psi4 <https://psicode.org/installs/v14/>`__\  for more download options.

Run programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, you can try to run a program to verify whether the Paddle Quantum has been installed successfully. Here we take quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) as an example.

.. code:: shell

   cd paddle_quantum/QAOA/example
   python main.py

..

.. note:: For the introduction of QAOA, please refer to our `QAOA tutorial </tutorials/combinatorial-optimization/quantum-approximate-optimization-algorithm.html>`__.
