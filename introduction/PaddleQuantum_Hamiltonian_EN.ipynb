    "The Hamiltonian of a quantum system is an observable related to the total energy of the system and has important applications in quantum simulation algorithms such as the [Variational Quantum Eigensolver](https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/quantum-simulation/variational-quantum-eigensolver.html) and [Hamiltonian Simulation with Product Formula](https://qml.baidu.com/tutorials/quantum-simulation/hamiltonian-simulation-with-product-formula.html). In quantum computing, the Hamiltonian needs to be represented in the form of a sum of tensor products of Pauli operators that can be processed by a quantum computer. For example, the following Hamiltonian is represented in this form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H =  Z \\otimes Z \\otimes I +  I \\otimes X \\otimes Z\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Paddle Quantum, users can create Hamiltonians in the form of Pauli strings by defining a list of the coefficients and corresponding Pauli operators for each term in the Hamiltonian. The identity operator $I$ can be omitted in each Pauli operator term. Let's try to create the Hamiltonian above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Paddle Quantum, users can create Hamiltonians by defining a list that contains information about multiple tensor products of Pauli operators. Each element of the list should include the coefficient and the string representation of the corresponding Pauli operator. For example, the first term in the Hamiltonian $H$ above is $Z \\otimes Z \\otimes I$, with a coefficient of $1$ and a corresponding string representation of 'Z0, Z1'，where 'Z0' and 'Z1' indicate that the Pauli operator acts on the 0-th and 1st qubits, respectively. Here, the identity operator $I$ can be omitted. Let's try to create the Hamiltonian $H$ above.\n",

    "## Common Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in `decompose_pauli_words()` and `decompose_with_sites()` methods in `Hamiltonian` can extract the various Pauli operators and their corresponding coefficients in the Hamiltonian and decompose them into a more convenient form. Among them, decompose_pauli_words() decomposes the Hamiltonian into two parts, a coefficient list and a corresponding Pauli string list. A Pauli string representation of a $n$-qubit Pauli operator is a string of $n$ characters derived from the set $\\{'I', 'X', 'Y', 'Z'\\}$. For example, the Pauli string representation of the Pauli operator $Z \\otimes Z \\otimes I$ is 'ZZI'; decompose_with_sites() decomposes the Hamiltonian into three parts, which are the coefficient list, the simplified form of the Pauli string list, and the list of qubit indices on which they respectively act. For example, the Pauli string representation of the Pauli operator $I \\otimes X \\otimes Z$ is 'IXZ', which further simplifies to 'XZ', and is identified by the list [1, 2] to indicate the qubit indices on which 'X' and 'Z' respectively act.\n",
