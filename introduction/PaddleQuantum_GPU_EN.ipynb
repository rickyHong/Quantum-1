    "In deep learning, people usually use GPU for neural network model training because GPU has significant advantages in floating-point operations compared with CPU. Therefore, using GPU to train neural network models has gradually become a common choice. In Paddle Quantum, our quantum states and quantum gates are also represented by complex numbers based on floating-point numbers. If our model can be deployed on GPU for training, it will also significantly increase the training speed."

    "## GPU selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we choose Nvidia's hardware devices, and its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) supports deep learning framework better. PaddlePaddle can also be easily installed on CUDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configure CUDA environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install CUDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we introduce how to configure the CUDA environment in Windows 10 on the x64 platform. First, check on [CUDA GPUs | NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) to see if your GPU support the CUDA environment. Then, download the latest version of your graphics card driver from [NVIDIA Driver Download](https://www.nvidia.cn/Download/index.aspx?lang=cn) and install it on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [PaddlePaddle Installation Steps](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick), we found that **Paddle Paddle only supports CUDA CUDA 9.0/10.0/10.1/10.2/11.0 single card mode under Windows**, so we install CUDA10.2 here. Find the download link of CUDA 10.2 in [CUDA Toolkit Archive | NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive): [CUDA Toolkit 10.2 Archive | NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.2-download-archive). After downloading CUDA, run the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the installation process, select **Custom Installation** in the CUDA options, check all the boxes except for Visual Studio Integration (unless you are familiar with it). Then check CUDA option only. Then select the default location for the installation location (please pay attention to the installation location of your CUDA, you need to set environment variables later), and wait for the installation to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the installation is complete, open the Windows command line and enter `nvcc -V`. If you see the version information, the CUDA installation is successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install cuDNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Download cuDNN in [NVIDIA cuDNN | NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), according to [PaddlePaddle Installation Steps](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick) requirements, we **need to use cuDNN 7.6.5+**, so we can download the version 7.6.5 of cuDNN that supports CUDA 10.2. After downloading cuDNN, unzip it. Assuming the installation path of our CUDA is `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.2`. After decompressing cuDNN, we take the files in `bin`, `include` and `lib` and replace the corresponding original files in the CUDA installation path (if the file already exists, replace it, if it does not exist, paste it directly into the corresponding directory). At this point, cuDNN has been installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you need to configure environment variables. Right-click \"This PC\" on the desktop of the computer (or \"This PC\" in the left column of \"File Explorer\"), select \"Properties\", and then select \"Advanced System Settings\" on the left, under the \"Advanced\" column Select \"Environmental Variables\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you enter the setting page of environment variables, select `Path` in the `System variables`, and click `Edit`. In the page that appears, check if there are two addresses `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.2\\bin` and `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.2\\libnvvp`  (the prefix `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.2` should be your CUDA installation location), if not, please add them manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify that the installation is successful\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the command line and enter `cd C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v10.2\\extras\\demo_suite` to enter the CUDA installation path (this should also be your CUDA installation location). Then execute `.\\bandwidthTest.exe` and `.\\deviceQuery.exe` respectively. If both `Result = PASS` appear, the installation is successful.\n",

Ensure that the **python version is 3.5.1+/3.6+/3.7/3.8**, and use `python -m ensurepip` and `python -m pip --version` to check the pip version, **confirm it is 20.2.2+**. Then, use `python -m pip install paddlepaddle-gpu -i https://mirror.baidu.com/pypi/simple` to install the GPU version of PaddlePaddle.\n",
