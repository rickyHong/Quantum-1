    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computation utilizes the peculiar laws in the quantum world and provides us with a novel and promising way of information processing. The essence of quantum computation is to evolve the initially prepared quantum state into another expected one, and then make measurements on it to obtain the required classical results. However, the approaches of quantum state evolution are varied in different computation models. The widely used **quantum circuit model** [1,2] completes the evolution by performing quantum gate operations, which can be regarded as a quantum analog of the classical computing model. In contrast, **measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC)** provides a completely different approach for quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name suggests, the entire evolution in MBQC is completed via quantum measurements. There are mainly two variants of measurement-based quantum computation in the literature: **teleportation-based quantum computing (TQC)** model[3-5] and **one-way quantum computer (1WQC)** model [6-9]. The former requires joint measurements on multiple qubits, while the latter only requires single-qubit measurements. After these two variants were proposed, they were proved to be highly correlated and admit a one-to-one correspondence [10]. So without further declaration, **all of the following discussions about MBQC will refer to the 1WQC model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "MBQC is a unique model in quantum computation and has no classical analog. The model controls the computation by measuring part of the qubits of an entangled state, with those remaining unmeasured undergoing the evolution correspondingly. By controlling measurements, we can complete any desired evolution. The computation in MBQC is mainly divided into three steps. The first step is to prepare a resource state, which is a highly entangled many-body quantum state. This state can be prepared offline and can be independent of specific computational tasks. The second step is to sequentially perform single-qubit measurements on each qubit of the prepared resource state, where subsequent measurements can depend on previous measurement outcomes, that is, measurements can be adaptive. The third step is to perform byproduct corrections on the final state. Finally, we do classical data processing on measurement outcomes to obtain the required computation results. \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example of MBQC algorithms is shown in Figure 1. The grid represents a commonly used quantum resource state (called cluster state, see below for details). Each vertex on the grid represents a qubit, while the entire grid represents a highly entangled quantum state. We measure each qubit one by one in a specific measurement basis (In the vertices, X, Y, Z, XY, etc. represent the corresponding measurement basis), and then perform byproduct corrections (to eliminate the effect of Pauli X and Pauli Z operators), to complete the computation.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align:center\">Figure 1: A typical example of MBQC algorithm where computation is proceeded by measuring each qubit on the vertex. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"three-step\" process of MBQC has brought us quantities of benefits. For example, if the quantum state prepared in the first step is too noisy, we can simply discard this state **before computation begins** (that is, before any measurement is implemented), and prepare it again to ensure the accuracy of the computational results. Since the resource state can be prepared offline and independent of specific computing tasks, it can also be applied to secure delegated quantum computation [11,12] to protect clients' privacy. In addition, single-qubit measurement is easier to be implemented in practice than quantum gates. Non-adaptive quantum measurements can even be carried out simultaneously, thereby, reducing the computation depth and requiring less coherence time of the quantum system. The difficulty of realizing MBQC mainly lies in resource state preparation in the first step. Such a quantum state is highly entangled and the number of qubits required is much larger than that of the usual circuit model. For recent progress on the resource state preparation, please refer to [13,14]. Table 1 briefly summarizes both advantages and limitations of MBQC and quantum circuit models.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing MBQC and our module in more detail, let's briefly review the two building blocks of MBQC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Graph and graph state\n",
    "    \n",
    "Given a graph $G=(V, E)$ with vertices set $V$ and edges set $E$, we can prepare an entangled quantum state by initializing a plus state $|+\\rangle = (|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle) / \\sqrt{2}$ to each vertex of $G$ and performing a control Z operation $CZ = |0\\rangle\\langle 0| \\otimes I + |1\\rangle\\langle1|\\otimes Z$ between each connected qubit pair. The resulting quantum state is called the **graph state** of $G$, denoted by $|G\\rangle$, such that:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$\n",
    "|G\\rangle = \\prod_{(a,b) \\in E} CZ_{ab} \\left(\\bigotimes_{v \\in V}|+\\rangle_v\\right). \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of graph state is nothing particular. Actually, the well-known Bell state and GHZ state are both graph states up to local unitary transformations. Besides, if the underlying graph we consider is a 2D grid then the corresponding graph state is called **cluster state**, depicted in Figure 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Graph states](./figures/mbqc-fig-graph_states.jpg)\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\">Figure 2ï¼š(i) the graph of a $Bell$ state; (ii) the graph of a 4-qubit $GHZ$ state; (iii) the graph of a cluster state </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Projective measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum measurement is one of the main concepts in quantum information processing. In the circuit model, measurements are performed usually at the end of the circuit to extract classical results from the quantum state. However, in MBQC, quantum measurements are also used to drive the computation. In the MBQC model, we use single-qubit measurements by default and mainly use 0/1 projection measurement. According to Born's rule [17], given a projective measurement basis $\\{|\\psi_0\\rangle, |\\psi_1\\rangle\\}$ and a quantum state $|\\phi\\rangle$, the probability that the outcome $s \\in \\{0,1\\}$ occurs is given by $p(s) = |\\langle \\psi_s|\\phi\\rangle|^2$, and the corresponding post-measurement state is $| \\psi_s\\rangle\\langle\\psi_s|\\phi\\rangle / \\sqrt{p(s)}$. In other words, the state of the measured qubit collapses into $|\\psi_s\\rangle$, while the state of other qubits evolves to $\\langle\\psi_s|\\phi\\rangle / \\sqrt{p(s)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-qubit measurements are commonly used, especially the binary projective measurements on the $XY$, $YZ$ and $XZ$ planes, defined respectively by the following orthonormal bases,\n",
    "\n",
    "- XY-plane measurement: $M^{XY}(\\theta) = \\{R_z(\\theta) |+\\rangle, R_z(\\theta) |-\\rangle \\}$, reducing to $X$ measurement if $\\theta = 0$ and $Y$ measurement if $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$;\n",
    "\n",
    "- YZ-plane measurement: $M^{YZ}(\\theta) = \\{R_x(\\theta)|0\\rangle, R_x(\\theta)|1\\rangle\\}$, reducing to $Z$ measurement if $\\theta = 0$;\n",
    "\n",
    "- XZ-plane measurement: $M^{XZ}(\\theta) = \\{R_y(\\theta)|0\\rangle, R_y(\\theta)|1\\rangle\\}$, reducing to $Z$ measurement if $\\theta = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above definitions, we use $|+\\rangle = (|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)/ \\sqrt{2},|-\\rangle = (|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)/ \\sqrt{2}$, and $R_x, R_y, R_z$ are rotation gates around $x,y,z$ axes respectively."

    "## MBQC Module Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Model and code implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Three-step\" process\n",
    "\n",
    "As is mentioned above, MBQC is different from the quantum circuit model. The computation in MBQC is driven by measuring each qubit on a graph state. To be specific, the MBQC model consists of the following three steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph state preparation**: that is, to prepare a many-body entangled state. Given vertices and edges in a graph, we can prepare a graph state by initializing a plus state on each vertex and performing a control Z operation between each connected qubit pair. Since a graph state and its underlying graph have a one-to-one correspondence, it suffices to work with the graph only. In addition, we can selectively replace some of the plus states in the graph with a customized input state if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-qubit measurement**: that is, to perform single-qubit measurements on the prepared graph state with specific measurement bases. The measurement angles can be adaptively adjusted according to previous outcomes. Non-adaptive measurements commute with each other in simulation and can even be performed simultaneously in experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Byproduct correction**: Due to the random nature of quantum measurement, the evolution of the unmeasured quantum state cannot be uniquely determined. In other words, the unmeasured quantum state may undergo some extra evolutions, called **byproducts**. So the last step is to correct these to obtain the expected result. If the final output is not a quantum state but the measurement outcomes, it suffices to eliminate the effect of byproducts via classical data processing only.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the \"three-step\" process of MBQC includes graph state preparation, single-qubit measurement, and byproduct correction. The first two steps are indispensable while the implementation of the third step depends on the form of expected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement pattern and \"EMC\" language\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the \"three-step\" process, an MBQC model can also be described by the **EMC** language from the measurement calculus [18]. As is mentioned above, MBQC admits a one-to-one correspondence to the circuit model. We can usually call the MBQC equivalent of a quantum circuit as a measurement **pattern** while the equivalent of a specific gate/measurement is called **subpattern** [18]. In the \"EMC\" language, we usually call an entanglement operation \"an entanglement command\", denoted by \"E\"; call a measurement operation \"a measurement command\", denoted by \"M\"; call a byproduct correction operation \"a byproduct correction command\", denoted by \"C\". Therefore, in parallel with the\"three-step\" process, MBQC is also characterized by an \"EMC\" command list. The process of computation is to execute commands in the command list in order. However, to familiarize ourselves with MBQC quickly, we will adopt the conventional \"three-step\" process to describe MBQC in this tutorial. In a later tutorial [Speeding up quantum circuit simulation by MBQC](/tutorials/measurement-based-quantum-computation/speeding-up-quantum-circuit-simulation-by-mbqc.html), we will use the \"EMC\" language instead as it is more friendly for specific calculations. It should be noted that the \"three-step\" process and the \"EMC\" language are essentially the same things with different denotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of code implementation, we provide a simulation module ``simulator`` that mainly consists of a class `MBQC` with attributes and methods necessary for MBQC simulation. We can instantiate an MBQC class, create and perform our MBQC-based algorithms with it.\n",

    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After instantiation, we can call class methods step by step to complete the MBQC computation process. Here, we briefly introduce some frequently used methods and their functionalities in Table 2. Please refer to the API documentation for details.\n",

    "In the ``simulator`` module, we provide two simulation modes, \"graph\" and \"pattern\", corresponding to the two equivalent descriptions of the MBQC computation process respectively. If we set a graph, the whole computation needs to follow the \"three-step\" process. It is worth mentioning that we design a **vertex dynamic classification algorithm** to simulate the MBQC computation process efficiently. Roughly speaking, we integrate the first two steps of the process, change the execution order of entanglement and measurement operations automatically to reduce the number of effective qubits involved in the computation and thereby improve the efficiency.

In MBQC, this unitary gate can be realized in the following way [15]. As shown in Figure 3: prepare five qubits, with input on the leftmost qubit while output on the rightmost qubit; input a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ and initialize other qubits with $|+\\rangle$; apply a $CZ$ operation to each connected qubit pair; perform $X$-measurement on the first qubit and adaptive measurements in the $XY$-plane on the middle three qubits, with the four measured qubits' outcomes recorded as $s_1$, $s_2$, $s_3$, $s_4$; correct byproducts to the state on qubit $5$ after all measurements. Then, the output state on qubit 5 will be $U|\\psi\\rangle$.\n",

    "CNOT gate is one of the most frequently used gates in the circuit model. In MBQC, the realization of a CNOT gate is shown in Figure 4 [7]: prepare $15$ qubits, with $1$, $9$ being the input qubits and $7$, $15$ being the output qubits; input a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ and initialize other vertices to $|+\\rangle$; apply a CZ operator to each connected qubit pairs; perform $X$-measurements on the vertices $1, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14$ and $Y$-measurement on the vertices $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12$ (Note: All of these measurements are non-adaptive measurements, so the order of their executions can be permuted); correct byproducts on $7$ and $15$ to obtain the output state $\\text{CNOT}|\\psi\\rangle$.\n",
