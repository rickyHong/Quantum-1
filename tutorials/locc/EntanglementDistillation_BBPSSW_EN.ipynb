    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum entanglement plays a vital role in quantum communication, quantum computing, and many other quantum technologies. Therefore, detecting, transmitting, and distributing quantum entanglement reliably are essential tasks if we want to build real applications in those fields. However, errors are inevitable in the real world. They could come from imperfect equipment when we create entanglement (preparation errors), or the quantum channel used to transmit entanglement is noisy, and we gradually lose the degree of entanglement as the transmission distance increases. The aim of entanglement distillation is to compensate for those losses and restore a **maximally entangled state** at the cost of many noisy entangled states. In this sense, one could also refer entanglement distillation as a purification/error-correction protocol. This process often involves two remote parties Alice and Bob such that only Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) are allowed [1]. The concept of entanglement distillation was first introduced by Bennett et al. [2] in 1996 and the original protocol is known as the **BBPSSW protocol** following the name of the authors."

    "\n",
    "As we can see, the simulation results matches the theoretical prediction perfectly. Through the BBPSSW protocol, we can extract an entangled state with a higher fidelity from two entangled states with low fidelities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "- Operations are simple. Only CNOT gates are required.\n",
    "- High success rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "- Strict requirements for the input state type. Isotropic states are preferred.\n",
    "- Poor scalability. Unable to directly extend to the case of multiple copies.\n",
